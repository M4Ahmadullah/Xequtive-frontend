# 🚨 Backend Issue: Hourly Rate Field Present But Not Displaying

## **Issue Summary**
The backend is correctly providing the `hourlyRate` field in the fare estimation response, but the frontend is not displaying the hourly rates in the vehicle selection screen for hourly bookings.

---

## **✅ What's Working**
- **Backend Response**: `hourlyRate` field is present in the API response
- **Frontend Receives Data**: Console logs show `First vehicle hourlyRate: 30`
- **API Call**: Fare estimation request is successful
- **Vehicle Data**: 8 vehicles are returned with correct pricing

---

## **❌ What's Not Working**
- **UI Display**: Hourly rates are not showing up in the vehicle cards
- **Frontend Logic**: The conditional rendering for hourly rates is not executing

---

## **🔍 Debug Information**

### **API Response Structure (Working)**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "fare": {
      "vehicleOptions": [
        {
          "id": "saloon",
          "name": "Standard Saloon",
          "price": { "amount": 90, "currency": "GBP" },
          "hourlyRate": 30,  // ✅ Present in response
          "capacity": { "passengers": 4, "luggage": 2 }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### **Frontend Console Logs (Working)**
```
🔍 NEW-BOOKING DEBUG - First vehicle hourlyRate: 30
🚗 VEHICLE DEBUG - Total vehicles from fareData: 8
🚗 VEHICLE DEBUG - Vehicle names: ["Standard Saloon", "Estate", ...]
🚗 VEHICLE DEBUG - Vehicle prices: [90, 105, 105, 120, 165, 90, 225, 255]
```

### **Missing Logs (Issue)**
The individual vehicle debug logs are NOT appearing:
```
🔍 VEHICLE DEBUG - Hourly booking: { ... }  // ❌ These logs are missing
```

This suggests the hourly rate display logic is not being executed for individual vehicles.

## **🧪 Test Case**

### **Request Payload**
```json
{
  "locations": {
    "pickup": {
      "address": "City of London, London, UK",
      "coordinates": { "lat": 51.5156, "lng": -0.0919 }
    },
    "stops": []
  },
  "datetime": {
    "date": "2025-09-09",
    "time": "20:46"
  },
  "passengers": {
    "count": 1,
    "checkedLuggage": 0,
    "mediumLuggage": 0,
    "handLuggage": 0,
    "babySeat": 0,
    "childSeat": 0,
    "boosterSeat": 0,
    "wheelchair": 0
  },
  "bookingType": "hourly",
  "hours": 3
}
```

### **Expected Response**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "fare": {
      "vehicleOptions": [
        {
          "id": "saloon",
          "name": "Standard Saloon",
          "price": { "amount": 90, "currency": "GBP" },
          "hourlyRate": 30,  // ✅ This is present
          "capacity": { "passengers": 4, "luggage": 2 }
        },
        {
          "id": "estate",
          "name": "Estate",
          "price": { "amount": 105, "currency": "GBP" },
          "hourlyRate": 30,  // ✅ This is present
          "capacity": { "passengers": 4, "luggage": 3 }
        }
        // ... more vehicles
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## **🔧 Frontend Code (Should Work)**

### **Vehicle Selection Component**
```typescript
// This code should display hourly rates but isn't working
{bookingType === 'hourly' ? (
  <div className="space-y-1">
    <div className="font-bold text-sm sm:text-lg md:text-xl tracking-tight font-mono notranslate whitespace-nowrap">
      £{vehicle.price.amount}
    </div>
    <div className="text-xs text-muted-foreground whitespace-nowrap">
      Total for {hours}h
    </div>
    {vehicle.hourlyRate ? (
      <div className="text-xs text-foreground font-medium notranslate">
        £{vehicle.hourlyRate}/hour  // ❌ This is not showing
      </div>
    ) : (
      <div className="text-xs text-muted-foreground notranslate">
        £{(vehicle.price.amount / hours).toFixed(0)}/hour
      </div>
    )}
  </div>
) : (
  // Other booking types
)}
```

## **🤔 Possible Issues**

### **1. Data Structure Mismatch**
- Backend might be providing `hourlyRate` in a different format
- Field might be nested differently than expected
- Data type might be string instead of number

### **2. Frontend Logic Issue**
- `bookingType` might not be correctly set to 'hourly'
- Vehicle rendering loop might not be executing the hourly logic
- Conditional rendering might have a bug

### **3. Data Processing Issue**
- Frontend might be processing the data incorrectly
- Vehicle options might be getting modified before display
- Type conversion might be failing

---

## **📋 Debugging Steps Needed**

### **1. Verify Backend Response Structure**
```bash
# Check the exact structure of the response
curl -X POST "YOUR_API_URL/api/fare-estimate/enhanced" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bookingType": "hourly",
    "hours": 3,
    "locations": { ... },
    "passengers": { ... }
  }' | jq '.data.fare.vehicleOptions[0]'
```

### **2. Check Field Names**
- Is it `hourlyRate` or `hourly_rate`?
- Is it `baseRate` or `ratePerHour`?
- Is it nested under a different object?

### **3. Verify Data Types**
- Is `hourlyRate` a number or string?
- Are there any type conversion issues?
- Is the field being filtered out somewhere?

---

## **🚨 Immediate Action Required**

The backend team needs to:

1. **Verify the exact field name** for hourly rates in the response
2. **Check the data structure** - is it at the root level of each vehicle?
3. **Confirm the data type** - should be a number
4. **Test with the exact payload** provided above
5. **Provide a sample response** with the correct structure

---

## **📞 Next Steps**

1. **Backend Team**: Verify the response structure and field names
2. **Frontend Team**: Debug why the conditional rendering isn't working
3. **Testing**: Use the exact test case provided above
4. **Resolution**: Ensure hourly rates display correctly in the UI

---

## **💡 Expected Outcome**

Once resolved, users should see:
- **Vehicle Name**: "Standard Saloon"
- **Total Price**: "£90"
- **Duration**: "Total for 3h"
- **Hourly Rate**: "£30/hour" ← This should appear
