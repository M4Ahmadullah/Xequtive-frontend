# Performance Optimization Guide

This document outlines performance optimization strategies for the Xequtive booking system.

## Current Optimizations

### 1. Image Optimization

- Using Next.js `<Image />` component instead of standard HTML `<img>` tags
- Proper width and height attributes to avoid layout shifts
- SVG icons for vehicle types to reduce network requests

### 2. Component Optimization

- Using React.memo for expensive components
- Implementing proper dependency arrays in useEffect and useCallback hooks
- Virtualization for long lists (e.g., location suggestions)

### 3. Redux Optimizations

- Selective state updates to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Using createSelector for memoized derived state
- Proper state normalization to reduce duplication

### 4. Code Splitting

- Dynamic imports for large components
- Route-based code splitting using Next.js App Router
- Lazy loading for components below the fold

## Future Optimization Opportunities

### 1. API Layer Improvements

- Implement request caching for frequently accessed data
- Add request deduplication to prevent duplicate API calls
- Consider implementing a stale-while-revalidate pattern

### 2. State Management Refinements

- Further state normalization to minimize redundant data
- Optimize selector functions to reduce recomputation
- Consider using Redux Toolkit's RTK Query for data fetching

### 3. UI Performance

- Implement skeleton screens for loading states
- Add transition animations to mask loading times
- Consider using React Suspense for data loading boundaries

### 4. Bundle Size Reduction

- Audit and remove unused dependencies
- Consider implementing tree-shaking for imported libraries
- Set up bundle analyzer to identify large dependencies

## Performance Metrics to Monitor

1. **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: How quickly the page becomes fully interactive
2. **First Input Delay (FID)**: Time from first user interaction to response
3. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Loading performance metric
4. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Visual stability metric
5. **Total Bundle Size**: JavaScript bundle size across all chunks

## Testing Performance

### Tools

- Lighthouse: For general performance auditing
- Chrome DevTools Performance panel: For detailed runtime performance
- WebPageTest: For real-world device testing
- Next.js Analytics: For tracking Core Web Vitals

### Testing Strategy

1. Test on real devices, not just emulators
2. Implement benchmarking for critical user paths
3. Set up CI/CD performance regression testing
4. Test with throttled network conditions

## Component-Specific Optimizations

### LocationSelectionComponent

- Debounce location search input to reduce API calls
- Cache previous search results
- Pre-fetch popular locations

### VehicleSelectionContainer

- Implement virtualization for long lists of vehicles
- Optimize sorting algorithms for large vehicle lists
- Use IntersectionObserver for lazy loading vehicle images

### BookingSummary

- Memoize complex calculations
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders when parent components update

## Redux State Optimization

```tsx
// Example: Optimized selector with createSelector
import { createSelector } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

// Unoptimized - recalculates on every render
const getEligibleVehicles = (state) => {
  return state.api.fareData?.vehicleOptions?.filter(
    (v) => v.capacity.passengers >= state.booking.passengers
  );
};

// Optimized - only recalculates when dependencies change
const getEligibleVehicles = createSelector(
  [
    (state) => state.api.fareData?.vehicleOptions,
    (state) => state.booking.passengers,
  ],
  (vehicles, passengers) => {
    return vehicles?.filter((v) => v.capacity.passengers >= passengers);
  }
);
```

## Next Steps for Performance

1. Implement comprehensive performance monitoring
2. Set up regular performance audits
3. Establish performance budgets for key metrics
4. Document performance best practices for the team
